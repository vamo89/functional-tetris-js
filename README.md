# [WIP] Functional Tetris JS

A small project to test some functional js


## Improvements

- Performance (either)
  - Dirty checking (adding flag to state) or
  - Immutable structure
- For user experience
  - Increase dropInterval
  - Show next piece
  - Add restart button
- Code related
  - Add babel and webpack
    - es6 (especially for import/export)
    - hot reload
    - trailing commas FTW
  - Add Flowtype for correctness
